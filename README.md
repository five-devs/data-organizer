<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Hey, glad you found us. We’ve set out on the noble quest to make a compiler for the mountains of homework our fearless leader Leon assigns us. Though daunting, our goal is to set up a discord bot that finds all the assignments and places them in an environment where they are easy to access and less formidable to keep track of. Along the way we had several additional ideas that would make fun additions to our little project, a button that lets you know when Leon is live, a space for links that can be a little hard to get your hands on and much more. 

This project is by the 100devs community, for the 100devs community and we'd love if you helped contribute to this project!

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

This web app is used to track homework progress for the [100devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/) cohort. We actively organize the homework assignments and all you need to do is visit our site and keep track of what assignments you need or have completed. We wanted to make it easier to track your assignment progress and we hope you enjoy this project as much as we've enjoyed making it!
